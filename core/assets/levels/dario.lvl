# This is a simple level file.
# Comments start with a '#' and are ignored.
# ---
#
# To place objects, use the following syntax:
#
# T,x,y,sx,sy
# ',' separates the entries
# NO WHITESPACES allowed
#
# T     - object type (possible types are listed below)
#
# x,y   - position of the object in x and y coordinates
#       - 0 <= [x,y] < 1000
#       - [x,y] of type int
#       - 0,0 is bottom left
#
# sx,sy - scale factors in x and y direction, used to scale the graphics
#       - [sx,sy] of type float
#       - if the object is a player its initial direction
#
# --- list of items ---
# Currently the following items are available:
#
# P*  - player; with position and initial direction; * in [0,...,3]
# PB  - paint stand; a stand where all players can refill paint
# RO  - refill orange; a stand where orange can refill
# RG  - refill green; a stand where green can refill
# RB  - refill blue; a stand where blue can refill
# RP  - refill purple; a stand where purple can refill
# FH  - fence horizontal
# FV  - fence vertical
# TS  - tree small
# TM  - tree medium
# TL  - tree large
# BSH - barrel stack horizontal
#
# ---
#
# That is it. Hopefully, we have time to add some more items.
# If you have any ideas for items, send an eMail!
